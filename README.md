DUKE MIDS QFC: Predicting Deposit Levels and Stress Testing

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze and forecast the gross deposits of FDIC-insured banks under various economic conditions using advanced modeling techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost and Prophet. By incorporating a stress test scenario (high-interest rate environment), the project aims to evaluate the potential impacts on bank deposits. This analysis provides actionable insights into the resilience of banks in response to economic shocks.
